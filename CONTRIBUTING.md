# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

Refer to the [GraphQL Guide](https://docs.guac.sh/guac-graphql/) to go through
a setup.  Optionally, you can also consult [docker compose
documentation](https://docs.guac.sh/setup/).

## Developer Certificate of Origin

We require all commits in a PR to contain a `Signed-off-by` line which can be
added by using the `-s` flag of `git commit`. This is to enforce
[a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/dco).

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

We also require two reviewers on every PR as this follows good security
practices. For reasoning, see
[CNCF Supply Chain Best Practices](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper/CNCF_SSCP_v1.pdf).

## Community Guidelines
